1. Why you chose the strategy you used

    -I came in having absolutely no idea what to begin with (being honest here), I spent 
        a good chunk of time examining the data and trying to figure out how to implement it 
        into my project. I learned what a geoJson file was, topoJson, and how i could use 
        csv files directly (by converting to json, although there may be other ways?). 

    -I have to say this was a tough one, for me at least, having absolutely no experience 
        with leaflet and little with d3.js. I spent the majority of my time working with d3.js 
        only to get stuck trying to draw geoJson file. So i decided to use leaflet instead and 
        avoid wasting more time. Leaflet was very simple, although I had to go through another 
        learning curve, but at the end I understood its function. 


    -My strategy after I 'learned' how to use leaflet, was to simply create a choropleth map 
        and have the user hover over the areas on the map, while the legend showed the exact information 
        the user was hovering over. Although i realize this was not the best way of representing 
        data, I had litle time left so I had to choose something simple.
 
 
 (my what if strategy)
 If i could re-do everything again with the knowledge i now have, I would draw choropleth maps with 
 different layers depicting different data (so as to avoid cluster and confusion) with leaflet, 
 as well as draw a dynamic dashboard with d3.js and react (they work wonders together). 



2. What you found most interesting about the project

    -The things you can do with leaflet are pretty awesome, I had no idea leaflet could draw 
        the border lines (or in our case area lines?) with simple polygon coordinates. Leaflet
        really makes everything easier for the developer, and allows him/her to focus on 
        representing the data. I'll definitely be working with leaflet from now on !  




3. How you would extend or improve the project youâ€™ve done for this prompt.

    -I'm pretty embarrassed that my web application isn't even halfway finished, but hypothetically if I 
        had more time, I would first delete the second view (FemalePop.ejs) and make it all into a one 
        page app. Using layers as my alternative to switch through different choroplet views, kind of like this example here 
        http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/. 


(I guess this part falls under future strategy)
    -I would define the relation between the amount of population in an area (age group, gender) with the amount of tweets sent 
        and businesses. With that information we can see what the hot spots in town are, and if a new business is looking 
        for an ideal strategic place this information can be a gold mine by targeting specific age groups, 
        gender, etc. 
        
    -As with the dashboard I mentioned in section 1, I would use react and d3 to represent the data a little differently.
        Instead of sticking solely with a map, I would use d3 and react to draw relationships in areas of interest, like
        mentioned on the above paragraph. 
    
    -And i want to apologize to you, who is reading this, my code might be a little bad organized. So i would 
        obviously organize, comment and make it beautiful. 
        
    
    
    
    
p.s 

While I know this may be a let down to all of you, (for not finishing the app) I really enjoyed 
the learning experience! This was a challenge, but an enjoyable challenge. I really feel like I learned 
a ton, and that is never time wasted.

Thank you for this opportunity :)
